Element is a 5 week game created in Unity by myself, Donald Hatch, Lilly Scheibelhut, and David Troxler.
Its a bullet-hell style game that has a slight rock-paper-siccors element to it.

I was the Lead Programmer on this game. I programmed the GUI, the player, damage for all entities,
level transitions, and various other things.

Source examples shows a couple of files that I wrote for the game and the video shows some of the game play, as well 
as some of my thoughts on the game.
