Element is a 5 week game created in Unity by myself, Donald Hatch, Lilly Scheibelhut, and David Troxler.
Its a bullet-hell style game that has a slight rock-paper-scissors element to it.

I was the Lead Programmer on this game. I programmed the GUI, the player, the weapons,
level transitions, and various other things.

Source examples shows a couple of files that I wrote for the game and the video shows some of the game play, as well 
as some of my thoughts on the game.

Cool things in this game:
-3 different weapons
-4 unique areas and bosses
-a story and bosses that change depending on your success or failure
-local co-op
