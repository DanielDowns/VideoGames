Element is a 5 week game created in Unity by myself, Donald Hatch, Lilly Scheibelhut, and David Troxler.
Its a bullet-hell style game that has a slight rock-paper-siccors element to it.

I was the Lead Programmer on this game. I programmed the GUI, the player, damage for all entities,
level transitions, and various other things.
