Most games are too big to enclude the .exe so I've provided screenshots and videos as well
as a couple of source code files for kicks (yes the code is a mess. We were incredibly
pressed for time in pretty much every case). If you really want to play one, let me know 
and I can send you a link to a dropbox folder.
