README for Exhaustion

Exhaustion is a top down 2D maze runner built in Unity. It was made by myself, Donald Hatch, 
William Duet, and Sean Owens.

I was the Lead Programmer on this game. I programmed the player character, hooked up the physics (using 
Unity's built in physics), the oxygen timer, the moving lava, and various other things.
