README for Exhaustion

Exhaustion is a top down 2D maze runner built in Unity. It was made by myself, Donald Hatch, 
William Duet, and Sean Owens in 3 weeks.

I was the Lead Programmer on this game. I programmed the player character, hooked up the physics (using 
Unity's built in physics), the oxygen timer, the moving lava, and various other things.

Source Examples has several source files I wrote for the game and the video shows parts of a playthrough.
