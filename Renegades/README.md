README for Renegades

Renegades is a collection of small games that combine to form a larger game with a heavy emphasis on story.
It was developed in Unity by myself, Sean Owens, Lilly Scheibelhut, and Jon Lalo. 

I was the Lead Gameplay Programmer. I developed the Top Down Shooter, Bullet Hell, Base Attack, and Space
Dogfight levels, coordinated the voice acting for the game, and completed various other tasks.
