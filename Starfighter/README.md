Starfighter is a 2D space shooter I work on in my spare time. Its not planned to be 
published, its just a fun outlet when I want to code on something. These samples 
relate to the AI of the other ships in the game, specifically the squadrons of 
fighters.

Because of how GameMaker works, I can't include the Ship objects these scripts are attached
to which, in addition to the scripts linked, deal mostly with the overhead of intializing, 
minor tending, and destroying the objects.
